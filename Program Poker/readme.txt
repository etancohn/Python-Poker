Project Title: Program Poker

This is a Texas Hold'em poker game. It runs a single player poker game with 
graphics against AI, and you can choose how many players to play against.

How to run: Start the game from the ProgramPoker.py file. Make sure to have
the graphics images in the same folder as ProgramPoker.py, since the program
loads these images.

Libraries: The only library necessary is CMU_112_graphics.

Commands: There are icons on the top right of the game mode screen that can
be used in the game. The dice icon takes you to a screen that shows your 
probabilities of getting different hand types. The cards icon takes you to a 
list of hand classifications and their ranks.
